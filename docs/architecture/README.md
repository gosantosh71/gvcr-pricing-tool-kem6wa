# VAT Filing Pricing Tool Architecture

This directory contains the architectural documentation for the VAT Filing Pricing Tool, a comprehensive web-based application designed to provide businesses with accurate cost estimates for VAT filing services across multiple jurisdictions.

The architecture documentation is organized into several key documents that provide different perspectives on the system design, from high-level overviews to detailed component interactions.

## Documentation Structure

The architecture documentation is organized as follows:

- **[System Overview](system-overview.md)**: Provides a comprehensive overview of the VAT Filing Pricing Tool system architecture, including core components, architectural principles, system boundaries, and key design decisions.

- **[Component Diagram](component-diagram.md)**: Illustrates the system's architecture, component relationships, and interactions between different layers and services.

- **[Data Flow Diagram](data-flow-diagram.md)**: Shows how data moves through the system's components, including authentication flows, pricing calculation flows, reporting flows, and integration with external systems.

- **[Security Architecture](security-architecture.md)**: Details the security architecture, including authentication mechanisms, authorization framework, data protection strategies, threat protection measures, and compliance controls.

## Key Architectural Decisions

The VAT Filing Pricing Tool is built on the following key architectural decisions:

1. **Cloud-based Microservices Architecture**: The system is deployed on Microsoft Azure using a microservices approach to enable scalability, resilience, and independent service development.

2. **API-First Design**: All services expose well-defined APIs, enabling loose coupling and interoperability between components.

3. **Event-Driven Communication**: Asynchronous, event-driven communication is used for operations that don't require immediate responses, improving system responsiveness.

4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect sensitive financial and business data at different levels of the architecture.

5. **Configuration Externalization**: Environment-specific settings are stored outside the application code for flexible deployment across environments.

## Technology Stack

The VAT Filing Pricing Tool is built using the following core technologies:

- **Frontend**: Blazor WebAssembly with Microsoft Fluent UI
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core 6.0+ with C# 10.0
- **API Design**: REST with JSON
- **Authentication**: Azure Active Directory + JWT tokens
- **Databases**: Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Redis Cache
- **Storage**: Azure Blob Storage
- **Infrastructure**: Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure API Management, Azure Front Door
- **Monitoring**: Azure Monitor, Application Insights, Log Analytics

## System Context

The VAT Filing Pricing Tool interacts with the following external systems:

- **Microsoft Dynamics 365**: For retrieving transaction data and business information
- **Azure Active Directory**: For user authentication and identity management
- **Azure Cognitive Services**: For document processing and OCR capabilities
- **Tax Authority Systems**: For retrieving up-to-date VAT rates and regulations

These integrations are detailed in the component and data flow diagrams.

## Deployment Architecture

The system is deployed across two Azure regions (West Europe as primary, North Europe as secondary) to provide high availability and disaster recovery capabilities. The deployment architecture includes:

- **Multi-region deployment** with Azure Front Door for global load balancing
- **Containerized services** orchestrated with Azure Kubernetes Service
- **PaaS services** for databases, storage, and other managed services
- **Private endpoints** for secure communication between services
- **Comprehensive monitoring** with Azure Monitor and Application Insights

Detailed deployment diagrams are available in the component diagram documentation.

## Development Guidelines

When contributing to the VAT Filing Pricing Tool, please adhere to the following architectural guidelines:

1. **Maintain Service Boundaries**: Respect the defined service boundaries and communication patterns.
2. **Follow Security Practices**: Implement security controls as defined in the security architecture.
3. **Document Changes**: Update the architecture documentation when making significant changes.
4. **Consider Scalability**: Design components to scale horizontally when possible.
5. **Implement Resilience**: Use retry patterns, circuit breakers, and other resilience techniques.
6. **Maintain Observability**: Ensure all components emit appropriate logs and metrics.

## Architecture Evolution

The architecture of the VAT Filing Pricing Tool will evolve over time to address new requirements, improve performance, and incorporate new technologies. Major architectural changes will be documented in this repository with appropriate versioning.
