## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the VAT Filing Pricing Tool. It covers all testing levels, from unit tests to end-to-end tests, and defines the approach to test automation, quality metrics, and best practices. The strategy is designed to ensure the reliability, performance, and security of the application while supporting the development workflow.

## Testing Approach

The VAT Filing Pricing Tool implements a multi-layered testing approach to ensure comprehensive coverage of all application components and functionality.

### Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, with dependencies mocked or stubbed. The application uses xUnit as the primary testing framework with FluentAssertions for readable assertions and Moq for mocking dependencies.

Key principles for unit testing include:
- Test isolation: Each unit test must be independent and not rely on external systems
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern: All tests follow the AAA pattern for clarity and consistency
- Test naming convention: `[MethodName]_[Scenario]_[ExpectedResult]`
- Code coverage requirements: Minimum 80% code coverage for business logic and calculation components

Unit tests are implemented for:
- Controllers: Testing API endpoints with mocked services
- Services: Testing business logic with mocked repositories
- Repositories: Testing data access with in-memory databases
- Domain logic: Testing business rules and calculations
- UI components: Testing Blazor components with bUnit

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify the interaction between components and external systems. The application uses WebApplicationFactory for in-memory testing of API endpoints and TestContainers for database integration tests.

Key aspects of integration testing include:
- Service integration: Testing interactions between internal services
- Database integration: Testing data access layer with real database instances
- API contract testing: Validating API contracts and responses
- Authentication integration: Testing AAD integration with mock identity providers

Each integration test creates its own isolated environment with controlled dependencies to ensure test reliability and reproducibility.

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests validate complete user journeys through the application. The application uses Playwright for browser automation with support for multiple browsers.

E2E testing covers these key scenarios:
- User authentication: Login, registration, and permission-based access
- Pricing calculation: Complete pricing calculation workflow with various parameters
- Report generation: End-to-end report creation and export
- Integration flows: ERP data import and OCR document processing

The Page Object Model pattern is used to create maintainable UI automation tests, with each page represented by a class that encapsulates the page's elements and actions.

### Specialized Testing

In addition to the core testing types, the application implements specialized testing for specific quality aspects:

**Security Testing:**
- SAST: Static Application Security Testing using SonarQube and Microsoft Security Code Analysis
- DAST: Dynamic Application Security Testing using OWASP ZAP
- Penetration testing: Manual testing by security team on a quarterly basis
- Dependency scanning: OWASP Dependency Check for vulnerable dependencies

**Accessibility Testing:**
- Automated checks: Using axe-core and Lighthouse for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Manual testing: Screen reader testing and keyboard navigation verification
- Compliance validation: Color contrast, text alternatives, and input assistance checks

**Performance Testing:**
- Load testing: JMeter for simulating multiple users and measuring response times
- Stress testing: Identifying breaking points under extreme load
- Endurance testing: Verifying system stability over extended periods

## Test Automation

Test automation is a critical component of the testing strategy, enabling consistent quality validation and rapid feedback during development.

### CI/CD Integration

All tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps Pipelines:
- Build validation: Unit and integration tests run on every PR
- Nightly test runs: Complete test suite including E2E tests runs nightly
- Deployment gates: Successful test execution required for deployment to staging/production
- Failure notifications: Automated notifications for test failures via email and Teams

### Failed Test Management

The strategy includes a structured approach to managing test failures:
- Failure analysis: Automated categorization of failures as environment, data, or code issues
- Retry strategy: Selective retry of flaky tests up to 3 times with increasing delays
- Flaky test handling: Identified flaky tests moved to quarantine suite for investigation
- Test stability: Tracking test stability over time with automated reporting

### Parallel Execution

To optimize test execution time, tests are run in parallel where possible:
- Unit tests: Full parallelization with test isolation
- Integration tests: Parallelization with resource isolation
- E2E tests: Browser-based parallelization with separate contexts

Test parallelization is configured to balance execution speed with resource utilization, with appropriate isolation to prevent test interference.

## Quality Metrics

The testing strategy defines key quality metrics to measure testing effectiveness and application quality.

### Code Coverage

Code coverage is measured using Coverlet and reported in Azure DevOps:
- Overall coverage target: 80% minimum
- Core calculation logic: 90% minimum coverage
- Coverage gates: PRs must maintain or improve code coverage
- Coverage reporting: Detailed reports showing coverage by component

### Test Success Rate

Test success rate is tracked to ensure test reliability:
- Target success rate: 99.5% for all test runs
- Flaky test identification: Tests with inconsistent results are flagged for review
- Success trend analysis: Monitoring success rate over time to identify degradation

### Performance Thresholds

Performance tests enforce specific thresholds:
- API response time: < 1 second for standard endpoints
- Page load time: < 2 seconds for main application pages
- Calculation time: < 3 seconds for complex multi-country calculations
- Report generation: < 10 seconds for detailed reports

### Security Scan Results

Security testing enforces strict quality gates:
- Zero high or critical vulnerabilities allowed
- Medium vulnerabilities must be addressed within 2 weeks
- Low vulnerabilities tracked and prioritized in the backlog
- Dependency vulnerabilities addressed through regular updates

## Test Environment Architecture

The testing strategy defines a structured approach to test environments to ensure consistent and reliable testing.

### Environment Tiers

The testing strategy uses multiple environment tiers:
- Development: Local development environment with mock services
- CI environment: Isolated environment for automated tests in the CI pipeline
- Test environment: Dedicated environment for integration and E2E testing
- Staging environment: Production-like environment for final validation
- Production environment: Live system with monitoring and smoke tests

### Test Data Management

Test data is managed to ensure test reliability and data privacy:
- Reference data: Version-controlled seed data deployed with the application
- Test accounts: Predefined test users created during environment setup
- Transaction data: Generated test data created per test run with cleanup
- External system data: Mock responses stored as test fixtures

Key principles include data isolation, realistic test data, comprehensive cleanup, and no use of production or personally identifiable data in test environments.

### Containerization

Test environments leverage containerization for consistency and isolation:
- TestContainers: For database and service dependencies in integration tests
- Docker Compose: For local development and testing environments
- Kubernetes: For test environments in the CI/CD pipeline

Containerization ensures that tests run in consistent environments regardless of where they are executed, reducing environment-related test failures.

## Testing Tools and Frameworks
