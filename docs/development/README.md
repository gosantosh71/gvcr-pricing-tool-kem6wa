## Development Principles

The VAT Filing Pricing Tool project follows these development principles and practices:

- **Clean Architecture**: The application is organized into layers with clear separation of concerns
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Business logic is encapsulated in a rich domain model
- **Microservices Architecture**: The system is composed of loosely coupled services
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure is defined using ARM templates and Terraform
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment**: Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing features
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes require peer review before merging
- **Documentation as Code**: Keep documentation close to the code and update it as part of changes

## Development Workflow

The standard development workflow for the VAT Filing Pricing Tool project follows these steps:

1. **Issue Assignment**: Pick up an issue from the project board or create a new one for the work
2. **Branch Creation**: Create a feature or bugfix branch from the develop branch
3. **Local Development**: Implement the changes following the coding standards
4. **Testing**: Write and run tests to verify the changes
5. **Code Review**: Create a pull request and address feedback from reviewers
6. **CI/CD**: Ensure all automated checks pass in the CI/CD pipeline
7. **Merge**: Once approved, merge the changes into the develop branch
8. **Deployment**: Changes are automatically deployed to the development environment

For more detailed information on each step, refer to the specific documentation sections linked above.

## Development Tools

The following tools are recommended for development on the VAT Filing Pricing Tool project:

- **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code
- **Source Control**: Git with Azure DevOps or GitHub
- **Database Tools**: SQL Server Management Studio or Azure Data Studio
- **API Testing**: Postman or Insomnia
- **Container Management**: Docker Desktop
