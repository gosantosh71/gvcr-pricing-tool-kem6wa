# VAT Filing Pricing Tool Documentation

Welcome to the VAT Filing Pricing Tool documentation. This documentation provides comprehensive information about the architecture, API, development practices, and deployment procedures for the VAT Filing Pricing Tool.

## Project Overview

The VAT Filing Pricing Tool is a cloud-based application designed to provide businesses with accurate cost estimates for VAT filing services across multiple jurisdictions. It addresses the complex challenge of determining VAT filing costs based on various factors including business size, transaction volume, filing frequency, and country-specific tax regulations.

The system is built using .NET Core backend, Blazor/React frontend, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Active Directory integration, providing a secure, scalable enterprise solution for VAT filing cost estimation.
