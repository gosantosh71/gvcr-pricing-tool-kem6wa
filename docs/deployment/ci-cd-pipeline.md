## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the CI/CD pipeline for the VAT Filing Pricing Tool. The pipeline automates the building, testing, security scanning, and deployment of the application across development, staging, and production environments. The pipeline is implemented using Azure DevOps Pipelines and GitHub Actions, with appropriate quality gates and approval processes to ensure reliable and secure deployments.

## Pipeline Architecture

The CI/CD pipeline is structured into several interconnected workflows that handle different aspects of the application lifecycle:

### Build Pipeline

Responsible for compiling code, running tests, and creating deployable artifacts including Docker containers.

### Security Scanning Pipeline

Performs comprehensive security analysis including SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and container scanning.

### Infrastructure Deployment Pipeline

Manages the provisioning and configuration of Azure resources using Infrastructure as Code.

### Application Deployment Pipeline

Deploys the application components to the target environments with appropriate deployment strategies.

## Build Pipeline

The build pipeline is triggered on pull requests and commits to main branches. It performs the following key steps:

### Backend Build Process

1. Restore NuGet packages
2. Build backend solution
3. Run unit tests with code coverage
4. Run integration tests
5. Perform static code analysis with SonarCloud
6. Verify code coverage meets threshold (80%)
7. Build backend Docker image
8. Push Docker image to Azure Container Registry (on main branch only)

### Frontend Build Process

1. Restore NuGet packages
2. Build web project
3. Run web unit tests
4. Publish web project
5. Build web Docker image
6. Push Docker image to Azure Container Registry (on main branch only)

### Quality Gates

The build pipeline enforces several quality gates:

- All tests must pass
- Code coverage must meet or exceed 80%
- SonarCloud quality gate must pass
- No high or critical vulnerabilities in dependencies

## Security Scanning Pipeline

The security scanning pipeline runs on pull requests, commits to main branches, and on a weekly schedule. It includes:

### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

Uses GitHub CodeQL to analyze source code for security vulnerabilities, focusing on C# and JavaScript code.

### Dependency Scanning

Scans project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using:

- dotnet-retire for .NET dependencies
- npm-audit for JavaScript dependencies

### Container Scanning

Uses Trivy to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities in the base image and installed packages.

### Secret Scanning

Uses Gitleaks to detect secrets and sensitive information accidentally committed to the repository.

### Infrastructure as Code Scanning

Uses Checkov to scan Terraform configurations, ARM templates, and Kubernetes manifests for security misconfigurations.

### Security Reports

Generates comprehensive security reports that are uploaded as artifacts and can be reviewed by the security team.

## Infrastructure Deployment Pipeline

The infrastructure deployment pipeline manages the provisioning and configuration of Azure resources. It can be triggered manually or automatically when infrastructure code changes are pushed to the main branch.

### Deployment Methods

The pipeline supports two deployment methods:

- **ARM Templates**: Using Azure Resource Manager templates for declarative infrastructure
- **Terraform**: Using HashiCorp Terraform for multi-cloud infrastructure as code

### Deployment Process

1. Validate infrastructure code (ARM template validation or Terraform validate/plan)
2. Create or update resource groups in primary and secondary regions
3. Deploy infrastructure resources using the selected method
4. Initialize Key Vault with secrets
5. Deploy Kubernetes resources if specified
6. Validate deployed resources
7. Generate deployment report

### Environment-Specific Configurations

The pipeline uses environment-specific configurations:

- **Development**: Automated deployment on infrastructure code changes
- **Staging**: Manual trigger with validation
- **Production**: Manual trigger with approval gate and additional validation

## Application Deployment Pipeline

The application deployment pipeline deploys the application components to the target environments. It is triggered automatically when the build pipeline completes successfully on the main branch.

### Deployment to Development

1. Deploy infrastructure if needed
2. Deploy application components to AKS using rolling update strategy
3. Run health checks to verify deployment
4. Verify monitoring is receiving telemetry

### Deployment to Staging

1. Deploy infrastructure if needed
2. Deploy application components to AKS using canary deployment strategy (20% initial traffic)
3. Monitor canary deployment for 10 minutes
4. Promote to full deployment if successful
5. Run integration tests against staging environment
6. Verify monitoring and alerts

### Deployment to Production

1. Wait for manual approval
2. Deploy infrastructure if needed
3. Deploy application components to AKS using blue/green deployment strategy
4. Monitor blue/green deployment for 15 minutes
5. Promote to production if successful
6. Run smoke tests against production environment
7. Verify monitoring, alerts, and availability tests
8. Send deployment notification

### Deployment Strategies

The pipeline uses different deployment strategies based on the environment:

- **Development**: Rolling update for simplicity and speed
- **Staging**: Canary deployment to test with a subset of traffic
- **Production**: Blue/green deployment for zero-downtime updates with quick rollback capability

## Pipeline Triggers

The CI/CD pipeline components are triggered by different events:

### Build Pipeline Triggers

- Pull requests to main and develop branches
- Commits to main and develop branches
- Changes to source code, infrastructure code, or pipeline definitions

### Security Scanning Triggers

- Pull requests to main and develop branches
- Commits to main and develop branches
- Weekly scheduled run (Sunday at midnight)
- Manual trigger

### Infrastructure Deployment Triggers

- Manual trigger with environment selection
- Commits to main branch affecting infrastructure code
- Monthly scheduled run (1st day of month)

### Application Deployment Triggers

- Successful completion of build pipeline on main branch
- Manual trigger for specific environments

## Approval Gates

The pipeline includes several approval gates to ensure controlled deployment:

### Code Review

All pull requests require code review and approval before merging.

### Quality Gates

Automated quality gates in the build pipeline ensure code quality and test coverage.

### Security Validation

Security scanning results must be reviewed and approved for production deployments.

### Staging Validation

Deployment to staging environment must be validated before proceeding to production.

### Production Approval

Manual approval is required for production deployments, with a timeout of 72 hours (4320 minutes).

## Monitoring and Validation

The pipeline includes comprehensive monitoring and validation steps:

### Health Checks

Automated health checks verify that deployed services are responding correctly.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that the application components work together correctly.

### Smoke Tests

Smoke tests verify basic functionality after deployment to production.

### Telemetry Verification

Checks that Application Insights is receiving telemetry from the deployed application.

### Alert Configuration

Verifies that alert rules are properly configured for the environment.

### Error Rate Monitoring

Monitors error rates during canary and blue/green deployments to detect issues early.

## Rollback Procedures

The pipeline includes automated and manual rollback procedures in case of deployment failures:

### Automated Rollback

- Canary deployments automatically roll back if error rates exceed thresholds
- Blue/green deployments maintain the previous version for immediate rollback
- Infrastructure deployments validate resources and roll back on failure

### Manual Rollback

For situations requiring manual intervention:

1. Access the Azure DevOps pipeline or GitHub Actions workflow
2. Select the last successful deployment
3. Trigger a redeployment of that version
4. Verify the rollback was successful

### Emergency Procedures

For critical production issues:

1. Trigger the emergency rollback pipeline
2. Notify the incident response team
3. Update status page to inform users
4. Conduct post-incident review
