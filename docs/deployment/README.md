# VAT Filing Pricing Tool - Deployment Documentation

This section contains comprehensive documentation for deploying, maintaining, and monitoring the VAT Filing Pricing Tool in Azure environments.

## Overview

The VAT Filing Pricing Tool is deployed as a cloud-native application on Microsoft Azure using a containerized approach with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for microservices and Azure App Service for the web application. The deployment process is fully automated through CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps.

## Deployment Architecture

The system is deployed across multiple Azure regions with a primary region in Western Europe and a secondary region in Northern Europe for disaster recovery. The deployment uses Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and Terraform to ensure consistency and repeatability.

## Documentation Sections

### [CI/CD Pipeline](ci-cd-pipeline.md)
Details of the continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline implementation in Azure DevOps.

### [Environment Setup](environment-setup.md)
Instructions for setting up development, staging, and production environments in Azure.

### [Monitoring Setup](monitoring-setup.md)
Configuration of monitoring, alerting, and observability tools for the application.

### [Disaster Recovery](disaster-recovery.md)
Procedures and configurations for disaster recovery and business continuity.

## Infrastructure Resources

The infrastructure code and configuration files are located in the `/infrastructure` directory of the repository. This includes ARM templates, Terraform configurations, Kubernetes manifests, and deployment scripts.

- **ARM Templates**: `/infrastructure/azure/arm-templates/`
- **Terraform Configurations**: `/infrastructure/azure/terraform/`
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: `/infrastructure/kubernetes/`
- **Helm Charts**: `/infrastructure/helm/`
- **Deployment Scripts**: `/infrastructure/scripts/`

## Deployment Workflow

The deployment workflow follows these key steps:

1. Code changes are committed to the repository
2. CI pipeline builds and tests the application
3. Container images are created and pushed to Azure Container Registry
4. CD pipeline deploys the application to the target environment
5. Post-deployment tests verify the deployment
6. Monitoring confirms system health

## Environment Configuration

The application supports multiple deployment environments:

- **Development**: For active development and testing
- **Staging**: For pre-production validation
- **Production**: For live system serving users

Each environment has its own configuration settings and infrastructure resources.

## Security Considerations

Deployment processes incorporate security best practices:

- Secrets management through Azure Key Vault
- Least privilege access principles
- Network security with private endpoints
- Vulnerability scanning in the CI/CD pipeline
- Compliance validation before production deployment
