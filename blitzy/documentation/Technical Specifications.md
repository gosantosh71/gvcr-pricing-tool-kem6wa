## 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 5.1 HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

#### 5.1.1 System Overview

The VAT Filing Pricing Tool employs a **cloud-based microservices architecture** hosted on Microsoft Azure, designed to provide scalable, maintainable, and secure VAT filing cost estimation services. This architecture was selected to enable:

- **Separation of concerns**: Each microservice handles a specific business capability, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling.
- **Technology flexibility**: Services can use the most appropriate technologies for their specific requirements.
- **Resilience**: Failure in one service doesn't compromise the entire system.
- **Scalability**: Individual components can scale independently based on demand.

The system follows these key architectural principles:

- **API-first design**: All services expose well-defined APIs, enabling loose coupling and interoperability.
- **Event-driven communication**: For asynchronous operations and integration scenarios.
- **Defense in depth**: Multiple security layers protect sensitive financial and business data.
- **Configuration externalization**: Environment-specific settings are stored outside the application code.

System boundaries are clearly defined with external interfaces to:
- Microsoft Dynamics 365 and other ERP systems
- Azure Active Directory for authentication
- Azure Cognitive Services for document processing
- Client web browsers for user interaction

#### 5.1.2 Core Components Table

| Component Name | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Critical Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication Service | User identity management and access control | Azure AD, User Database | Security, compliance with identity standards |
| Pricing Engine | Calculate VAT filing costs based on multiple parameters | Rules Engine, Country Database | Calculation accuracy, performance |
| Rules Engine | Apply country-specific VAT rules and regulations | Country Database, Admin Configuration | Rule versioning, regulatory compliance |
| Integration Service | Connect with external systems (ERP, OCR) | Azure API Management, ERP APIs | Security, data transformation, resilience |
| Reporting Service | Generate and export detailed cost reports | Blob Storage, Pricing Engine | Format consistency, data accuracy |
| Admin Portal | Configure pricing models, rules, and user management | All services | Access control, audit logging |
| Client Application | Provide user interface for all system functions | All backend services | Responsiveness, usability, accessibility |

#### 5.1.3 Data Flow Description

The VAT Filing Pricing Tool's data flows follow a structured pattern:

1. **User Authentication Flow**: Client requests are authenticated through the Authentication Service, which integrates with Azure AD to validate user identity and permissions.

2. **Pricing Calculation Flow**: User inputs (transaction volumes, countries, service types) flow from the Client Application to the Pricing Engine, which consults the Rules Engine to apply country-specific VAT regulations and calculate accurate cost estimates.

3. **Integration Data Flow**: The Integration Service facilitates bidirectional data exchange with external systems:
   - Inbound: Transaction data from ERP systems and document data from OCR processing
   - Outbound: Cost estimates and reports to external systems

4. **Configuration Flow**: Administrative changes to pricing models and rules flow from the Admin Portal to the respective services and are persisted in the appropriate data stores.

5. **Reporting Flow**: Report generation requests flow from the Client Application to the Reporting Service, which retrieves data from the Pricing Engine and generates formatted reports stored in Azure Blob Storage.

Key data stores include:
- **Azure SQL Database**: Primary storage for user data, pricing models, and transaction records
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Storage for country-specific VAT rules and flexible configuration data
- **Azure Redis Cache**: Caching layer for frequently accessed data like pricing rules and calculation results
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Storage for generated reports and uploaded documents

    subgraph "Communication Patterns"
        J[Synchronous REST] --- K[Asynchronous Messaging]
        K --- L[Event-driven]
    end
```

#### Load Balancing Strategy

The system implements a multi-level load balancing strategy to ensure optimal resource utilization and high availability:

| Level | Implementation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Global | Azure Front Door | Geographic distribution, traffic routing |
| Service | Azure Load Balancer | Distribute traffic across service instances |
| Application | Custom load balancing | Workload distribution within services |
| Database | Azure SQL elastic pools | Balance database workloads |

#### Circuit Breaker Patterns

To prevent cascading failures when services become unavailable, the system implements circuit breaker patterns:

| --- | --- | --- |
| Integration Service | Polly with exponential backoff | Cache results, degraded functionality |
| Pricing Engine | Custom circuit breaker | Use simplified calculation model |
| Rules Engine | Health-based circuit breaker | Use cached rules, notify administrators |
| Reporting Service | Timeout-based circuit breaker | Queue report requests for later processing |

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open: Failure Threshold Exceeded
    Open --> HalfOpen: Timeout Period Elapsed
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Success Threshold Met
    HalfOpen --> Open: Failure Occurs
    
    note right of Closed
        Normal operation
        Failures counted
    end note
    
    note right of Open
        All requests fail fast
        No external calls made
    end note
    
    note right of HalfOpen
        Limited requests allowed
        Testing if service recovered
    end note
```

#### Retry and Fallback Mechanisms

| Service | Retry Strategy | Fallback Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication | 3 retries with linear backoff | Redirect to alternative auth provider |
| ERP Integration | 5 retries with exponential backoff | Manual data entry option |
| OCR Processing | 2 retries with jitter | Manual document review |
| Database Operations | Automatic retry with backoff | Read from replica, in-memory cache |

    O --> P{Recovered?}
    P -->|Yes| C
    P -->|No| Q[Adjust Degradation Level]
    Q --> D
```

### 6.1.4 SERVICE INTERACTION PATTERNS

The VAT Filing Pricing Tool implements several service interaction patterns to ensure efficient communication between components:

#### Request-Response Pattern

Used for synchronous operations where an immediate response is required:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API as API Gateway
    participant Auth as Authentication Service
    participant Pricing as Pricing Engine
    participant Rules as Rules Engine
    
    Client->>API: Calculate Price Request
    API->>Auth: Validate Token
    Auth-->>API: Token Valid
    
    API->>Pricing: Forward Request
    Pricing->>Rules: Get Applicable Rules
    Rules-->>Pricing: Return Rules
    
    Pricing->>Pricing: Calculate Price
    Pricing-->>API: Return Result
    API-->>Client: Return Formatted Response
```

#### Event-Driven Pattern

## 6.6 TESTING STRATEGY

### 6.6.1 TESTING APPROACH

#### Unit Testing

| Aspect | Approach | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Testing Frameworks | xUnit for .NET | Primary framework for backend unit tests with FluentAssertions for readable assertions |
| JavaScript Testing | Jest | For React/Blazor component testing with React Testing Library |
| Test Organization | Feature-based structure | Tests organized by feature/component matching the application structure |
| Mocking Strategy | Moq for .NET | Primary mocking framework for .NET services with AutoFixture for test data generation |

The unit testing approach follows these key principles:

- **Test Isolation**: Each unit test must be independent and not rely on external systems
- **Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**: All tests follow the AAA pattern for clarity and consistency
- **Test Naming Convention**: `[MethodName]_[Scenario]_[ExpectedResult]` (e.g., `CalculatePrice_WithMultipleCountries_ReturnsSumOfCountryCosts`)
- **Code Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% code coverage for business logic and calculation components

    subgraph "Mock Strategy"
        J[Interface-based Design] --> K[Moq Framework]
        K --> L[Mock Repository Pattern]
    end
```

#### Integration Testing

| Aspect | Approach | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API Testing | REST API Tests | Using WebApplicationFactory for in-memory testing of API endpoints |
| Database Testing | EF Core Testing | Using TestContainers for SQL Server database integration tests |
| External Services | WireMock.NET | For mocking external service responses (ERP, OCR) |
| Test Environment | Isolated per test | Each test creates its own isolated environment with controlled dependencies |

Integration testing strategy includes:

- **Service Integration**: Testing interactions between internal services
- **Database Integration**: Testing data access layer with real database instances
- **API Contract Testing**: Validating API contracts and responses
- **Authentication Integration**: Testing AAD integration with mock identity providers

```mermaid

    subgraph "External Service Strategy"
        L[WireMock.NET] --> M[Mock HTTP Responses]
        M --> N[Response Templates]
        N --> O[Scenario-Based Responses]
    end
```

#### End-to-End Testing

| Aspect | Approach | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E2E Framework | Playwright | For browser automation with support for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit |
| Test Scenarios | User Journeys | Tests based on complete user journeys from login to report generation |
| UI Testing | Page Object Model | Using POM pattern for maintainable UI automation |
| Performance Testing | JMeter | For load and performance testing of critical paths |

End-to-end testing covers these key scenarios:

- **User Authentication**: Login, registration, and permission-based access
- **Pricing Calculation**: Complete pricing calculation workflow with various parameters
- **Report Generation**: End-to-end report creation and export
- **Integration Flows**: ERP data import and OCR document processing

```mermaid

    subgraph "Test Data Management"
        N[Predefined Test Accounts] --> O[Isolated Test Data]
        O --> P[Data Cleanup Hooks]
    end
```

### 6.6.2 TEST AUTOMATION

| Aspect | Implementation | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CI/CD Integration | Azure DevOps Pipelines | Automated test execution on PR creation and merge to main branches |
| Test Triggers | Event-based execution | Tests triggered by code changes, scheduled runs, and manual triggers |
| Parallel Execution | Test parallelization | Unit and integration tests run in parallel with test isolation |
| Reporting | Azure DevOps Test Reports | Centralized test reporting with trend analysis and failure tracking |

The test automation strategy includes:

- **Build Validation**: All PRs require passing tests before merging
- **Nightly Test Runs**: Complete test suite runs nightly on main branches
- **Deployment Gates**: Successful test execution required for deployment to staging/production
- **Failure Notifications**: Automated notifications for test failures via email and Teams

```mermaid
