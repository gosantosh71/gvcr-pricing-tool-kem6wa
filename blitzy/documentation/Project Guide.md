## Key Workflows

### Pricing Calculation Workflow

1. **User Input**: The user selects countries, service type, transaction volume, filing frequency, and additional services on the `PricingCalculator.razor` page.

2. **Validation**: The inputs are validated on the client side using the `CalculationValidator.cs`.

3. **API Request**: The validated inputs are sent to the backend API via the `PricingService.cs` frontend service, which calls the `PricingController.cs` API controller.

4. **Business Logic**: The `PricingController.cs` delegates to the `PricingService.cs` backend service, which uses the domain entities and rules to calculate the pricing.

5. **Rule Application**: The `RuleEngine.cs` applies country-specific rules from the `Rule.cs` entities to the calculation parameters.

6. **Result Generation**: A detailed pricing breakdown is generated and returned to the client.

7. **Result Display**: The results are displayed on the `PricingResults.razor` page, showing the total cost and breakdown by country and service.

### Report Generation Workflow

1. **Report Configuration**: The user configures report options on the `PricingResults.razor` page, including format, content sections, and delivery options.

2. **API Request**: The report request is sent to the backend API via the `ReportService.cs` frontend service, which calls the `ReportController.cs` API controller.

3. **Report Generation**: The `ReportController.cs` delegates to the `ReportService.cs` backend service, which generates the report using the `ReportGenerationHelper.cs`.

4. **Storage**: The generated report is stored in Azure Blob Storage using the `BlobStorageClient.cs`.

5. **Delivery**: The report is delivered according to the selected options (download, email).

6. **Download**: If immediate download is selected, the client is provided with a download link to the report.

### Authentication Workflow

1. **Login**: The user initiates login on the `Authentication.razor` page.

2. **Azure AD Authentication**: The user is redirected to Azure AD for authentication using the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL).

3. **Token Acquisition**: Upon successful authentication, Azure AD returns tokens to the application.

4. **Token Storage**: The tokens are stored securely using the `LocalStorageHelper.cs`.

5. **Authentication State**: The `TokenAuthenticationStateProvider.cs` manages the authentication state based on the stored tokens.

6. **API Authorization**: The `AuthorizationMessageHandler.cs` adds the authentication token to API requests.

7. **Token Refresh**: When tokens expire, they are refreshed automatically using the refresh token.

## Development Principles

The VAT Filing Pricing Tool project follows these development principles:

- **Clean Architecture**: The application is organized into layers with clear separation of concerns
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Business logic is encapsulated in a rich domain model
- **Microservices Architecture**: The system is composed of loosely coupled services
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure is defined using ARM templates and Terraform
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment**: Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing features
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes require peer review before merging
- **Documentation as Code**: Keep documentation close to the code and update it as part of changes

## Coding Standards

### General Principles

- **Readability**: Write code that is easy to read and understand
- **Maintainability**: Follow SOLID principles and keep methods/classes focused
- **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and conventions
- **Documentation**: Document public APIs with XML comments
- **Error Handling**: Use exceptions for exceptional conditions, not for control flow

### C# Coding Standards

- **Naming Conventions**:
  - PascalCase: Classes, interfaces, methods, properties, public fields, namespaces, enums
  - camelCase: Local variables, parameters, private fields
  - UPPER_CASE: Constants

- **Code Style**:
  - Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
  - Use braces for all control structures
  - Place opening braces on the same line as the declaration
  - Limit line length to 120 characters
  - Use explicit access modifiers

- **Clean Code Practices**:
  - Follow SOLID principles
  - Use dependency injection for dependencies
  - Keep methods focused on a single responsibility
  - Limit method parameters (aim for <= 3)
  - Use guard clauses for parameter validation

### Domain-Driven Design Practices

- Place domain entities, value objects, and domain services in the Domain project
- Make domain entities rich with behavior, not just data containers
- Use value objects for concepts with no identity (Money, CountryCode, etc.)
- Implement domain validation within entities
- Use factory methods for complex object creation

### Blazor WebAssembly Standards

- Use a consistent folder structure for components
- Design components to be reusable and composable
- Use parameters for component configuration
- Implement cascading parameters for shared state
- Keep components small and focused
- Use CSS isolation for component styling

## Branching Strategy

The project follows a modified GitFlow branching model:

### Core Branches

- **main**: The production branch containing the code currently deployed to production
- **develop**: The integration branch for features being developed for the next release

### Supporting Branches

- **feature/**: Short-lived branches for developing new features or enhancements
- **bugfix/**: Short-lived branches for fixing bugs in the develop branch
- **hotfix/**: Short-lived branches for critical fixes to production code
- **release/**: Short-lived branches for preparing releases
- **docs/**: Short-lived branches for documentation updates only
- **refactor/**: Short-lived branches for code refactoring without changing functionality

### Branch Naming Conventions

All supporting branches should follow this naming pattern:
```
<type>/<issue-id>-<short-description>
```

Examples:
```
feature/123-country-selector-component
bugfix/456-fix-calculation-rounding-error
hotfix/789-critical-security-vulnerability
release/v1.2.0
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

The project follows the Conventional Commits specification:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types include: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build

Examples:
```
feat(calculator): add support for multiple countries

Implement the ability to select multiple countries for VAT calculations.
The country selector now supports multi-select functionality with search.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(api): correct calculation rounding error

Fix decimal rounding issue in VAT calculations that caused small
discrepancies in the final amount.

Fixes #456
```

## Development Workflow

The standard development workflow follows these steps:

1. **Issue Assignment**: Pick up an issue from the project board or create a new one
2. **Branch Creation**: Create a feature or bugfix branch from the develop branch
3. **Local Development**: Implement the changes following the coding standards
4. **Testing**: Write and run tests to verify the changes
5. **Code Review**: Create a pull request and address feedback from reviewers
6. **CI/CD**: Ensure all automated checks pass in the CI/CD pipeline
7. **Merge**: Once approved, merge the changes into the develop branch
8. **Deployment**: Changes are automatically deployed to the development environment

## Testing Strategy

The VAT Filing Pricing Tool implements a multi-layered testing approach:

### Unit Testing

- Test isolation: Each unit test must be independent
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern: All tests follow the AAA pattern
- Test naming convention: `[MethodName]_[Scenario]_[ExpectedResult]`
- Code coverage requirements: Minimum 80% code coverage for business logic

### Integration Testing

- Service integration: Testing interactions between internal services
- Database integration: Testing data access layer with real database instances
- API contract testing: Validating API contracts and responses
- Authentication integration: Testing AAD integration with mock identity providers

### End-to-End Testing

- User authentication: Login, registration, and permission-based access
- Pricing calculation: Complete pricing calculation workflow
- Report generation: End-to-end report creation and export
- Integration flows: ERP data import and OCR document processing

### Specialized Testing

- Security Testing: SAST, DAST, penetration testing, dependency scanning
- Accessibility Testing: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checks
- Performance Testing: Load testing, stress testing, endurance testing

## CI/CD Integration

The branching strategy is designed to work seamlessly with the CI/CD pipeline:

### Automated Builds

- Pull requests trigger build and test workflows
- Pushes to `develop` trigger build, test, and deployment to the development environment
- Pushes to `main` trigger build, test, and deployment to the staging environment
- Tags trigger build, test, and deployment to the production environment

### Environment Mapping

- **develop branch**: Deploys to Development environment
- **main branch**: Deploys to Staging environment
- **release tags**: Deploy to Production environment

## Docker Development Environment

The project includes Docker Compose configuration for running the entire application stack locally:

1. From the root directory, start the Docker Compose environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. This will start the following services:
   - SQL Server database
   - Redis Cache
   - Backend API
   - Frontend Web Application

3. Access the applications:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:8080
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8081
   - Swagger Documentation: http://localhost:8081/swagger

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Database Connection Issues
- Verify the connection string in `appsettings.Development.json`
- Ensure SQL Server is running
- Check firewall settings if using Azure SQL

#### Redis Connection Issues
- Verify Redis is running
- Check the Redis connection string
- Ensure Redis port (6379) is not blocked by firewall

#### Authentication Issues
- Verify Azure AD configuration
- Check client ID and tenant ID
- Ensure redirect URIs are correctly configured
- Try using development authentication mode for local testing

#### Docker Issues
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- Check if ports are already in use
- Verify Docker resource allocation (memory, CPU)
- Try rebuilding the images: `docker-compose build --no-cache`
